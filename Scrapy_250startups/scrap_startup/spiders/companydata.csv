We are proud to share that we processed 5.9 million items annually, and we are serving more than 1200 registered merchants across 4 countries.

Problem
Southeast Asia’s e-commerce boom has caught traditional fulfilment and logistics players off-guard and unprepared. Furthermore, brick and mortar brands struggle to penetrate the region’s complex e-commerce market and have difficulty realizing meaningful sales on online marketplaces.

- Slow: The traditional fulfilment and logistics supply chain take 3-5 days, on average, to deliver a product to a customer’s doorstep, well behind international standards.
- Inefficient: Without tech-enabled optimization, fulfilment players typically hold inventory for ~90 days and have 50% utilization rates at their warehouses.
- Inaccessible: International and local brands struggle to break into the e-commerce market. iStore’s Gateway clients saw just 10-20% YoY sales growth prior to working with iStore.

Solution
iStore provides tech-enabled, end-to-end fulfilment services and can completely manage online operations for enterprise clients through its Gateway product.

- Fast: iStore is able to sort, pack, and deliver a package to a consumer’s doorstep in 2.5 days, on average.
- Efficient: By optimizing inventory and leveraging economies of scale at iStore’s state of the art facilities, iStore holds inventory for just 45 days and the company increases operational efficiency by 20–50%, with a 20–30% lower internal cost base than competitors.
- Accessible: With Gateway, brands are able to execute comprehensive plans to drive online sales.

Obviously this is quite a vision, but it does not come out of nowhere. The founders have each spent several years in Asia and realized that the focus in the sports industry is mostly only directed at professional sports. Regular people usually face many hurdles and difficulties to play sports on a regular basis. Sometimes due to lack of sport facilities, a limited personal network or simply because the effort to undertake sports is just too much. There are limited initiatives to consolidate the market. WeSport intends to change this by initially taking away the barriers, introduce new sports, support innovation and at the same time connect people through their passion for sports. Asia is known for its large, fast growing and especially young population. Standard of living has been increasing rapidly and a healthy lifestyle is increasingly important for people. Hence, investing in making it easier for people to play sports on a regular basis not only benefits the community, but also the sector in general.

Through two native apps, WeSport is connecting the complete sports community (facilities, sportsmen and brands). Facilities will receive a free to use facility management (booking) system directly linked to the social user app. Users are able to easily search - organise - play their favorite sports, which includes booking at the partnering facilities, find team-mates, opponents and much more, while getting rewarded for the effort! Brands will have the opportunity to reach the community much easier through focused marketing.

Established by experienced and talented technologists, experts and mentors, IBI Global has been coaching different multi-national companies for many years. Throughout this experience, we have found that there are three major barriers when it comes to optimize talents' competence and innovation development.

Barrier 1: Most communication failure in multi-national companies is due to the lack of English proficiency and fluency. 
 
Barrier 2: One of the main reasons why a training program fails is because it's hard to find the quality learning model that brings work - learn - life balance.
 
Barrier 3: Many believe that the key success of innovation is technology but it's not. It's culture and diversity! However, companies and organizations today encounter with finding the learning model that could bring expertise from different cultures into the training cost-effectively.

158,Ron Baetiong,Podcast Network Asia,https://podcastnetwork.asia/,,,September 2019,Philippines,"Vision: 
Podcast Network Asia’s dream is to make podcasting mainstream in Asia and to be the leading podcast content aggregator and producer. 

Problem:
Podcasting is on the cusp of unprecedented growth but there are common problems that prevent it from realising that potential which are the ff:
1. Podcast Production Standards are not consistent - As more people create podcasts, the audio quality varies which turns listeners and brands off
2. Podcast Monetization - Content creators do not know how to monetize their content
3. Podcast Analytics - Unlike other media, podcasts can be consumed in at least 2 dozen apps which makes the data difficult to aggregate and measure effectively

Product:
We help podcasters solve the problems mentioned above by doing the following:
1. Providing the best shows with world class audio production facilities (studio,equipment) and post-production staff to create great sounding audio
2. We help monetize the podcasts that we support and do a revenue share of 70/30 to 50/50 depending on how involved we are in the show
3. We created our podcast analytics platform called http://podmetrics.co that aggregates all the necessary metrics podcasters and brands care about under one platform

Founders: 
CEO: Ron Baetiong (2x Startup Founder, 1 Exit - ChatbotPH, Podcaster - Hustleshare)
COO: Josef Acuña (Capital Markets Lawyer for IPO, Media Production Expert)
CMO: Eileen Borromeo (Ad Agency Veteran - Former McCann Director, Head Southeast Asia Marketing - Payoneer)

Early Hires:

Head of Sales: Ellen Concepcion (ChatbotPH Top Seller)

Market: TAM: $300M in Southeast Asia with projections that market will be as big as the US in 5 years. 18% YOY growth in podcast consumption in Asia.

Business:  Since Sept 2019 we’ve made 35+ podcasts produced with 3.5 Million listeners combined and $50,000 in revenue",,The first and the biggest podcast network agency in the Philippines with over 35+ podcasts and 3.5 Million listens combined.

These are the challenges happening in the event industry today:
•	Companies who depended on physical events are struggling to connect with their customers, partners, and staff during the Pandemic
•	Individuals are trying to find ways to celebrate special events with their loved ones
•	Wedding plans are being disrupted
•	Event suppliers are badly hit by the slowdown and economic crisis

How did Onzla help solve this? 
We built an online platform and marketplace to allow Virtual Event Planning. Firstly, we gathered a large group of suppliers who could deliver and support events virtually, integrated them into an intelligent event planning algorithm and launched tools in the platform to allow companies and users to seamlessly connect, greet and send gifts to business associates and loved ones remotely 

With more than 3 million physical events planned in Singapore alone in 2019, we are confident we can replicate most of them virtually using Onzla until the pandemic subsides. And also cater to the massive opportunity in the SEA market with a population of 527 million!

At Onzla, our goals are simple: To ensure that no event should be ever hard to plan, regardless if it’s physical or virtual, every user gets the best deal and their guests show up for the party. We are committed to this dream and mission and will have fun making this happen!

The data economy is murky with the data often fragmented and of highly questionable authenticity. This causes major issues for companies and products who rely on data. Despite this major issue, there is an ever-increasing need for data. Nowhere is this more apparent than with mobile location data. 

As the demand for location data increases, there are now regulations to ensure that players in the space do not abuse the data they obtain. Examples of these regulations are the General Data Protection Act in Europe, and the California Consumer Privacy Act in the USA. Data providers that do not meet the requirements set out by these regulations face legal repercussions and must comply. Buyers of location data are also demanding that their providers of data be compliant, or risk losing business. 

Quadrant seeks to bridge this by becoming an industry leading location data provider and providing data buyers with legitimate, authenticated and verifiable location data. Our technologies allows for the mapping of data into verified, compliant, usable, targeted location datasets that de-clutter the field of information for professionals and organisations, allowing them to use inputs relevant to their needs and to analyse them effectively, efficiently, and with confidence.  

By creating an ecosystem that enables access to data that is authentic, traceable and mapped, Quadrant solves data challenges and spurs innovation.

allrites transforms the entire content buying and selling process by allowing buyers and sellers to transact through the platform thus reducing content distribution costs by 75% and reducing transaction cycle from months to a day.  

Content sellers list their titles for free and only pay a fee once they have sold content on the platform.  Listing process is simple and involves uploading the title, synopsis, rights availability information trailer and screener (episode of a show).   

Buyers (typically broadcasters such as Netflix, MediaCorp etc.) search for content by language, category, keywords, genre.  They shortlist content and make an offer to the seller via the platform.   Once buyer and seller agree a deal, the transaction is conducted via the platform.

We also offer a storage and delivery solution whereby sellers can seamlessly delivery their content to the buyer at the click of a button.

Our team has 70+ years track record in leading re-/insurance companies and financial services in Europe and Asia.

Riskwolf taps into a multi-billion protection gap of digital risks. During the last 25 years a big shift has been happening: more and more businesses are moving into the digital age but the insurance industry left a protection gap. Only 15% of all intangible assets are insurable. 

Riskwolf protects digital businesses from financial losses due to vulnerabilities in infrastructure, data, software and services. By connecting alternative data providers, distribution partners and risk carrier(s) we enable event-based insurance product innovation.

Riskwolf's first product is a loss protection coverage against Internet outages for digital businesses in emerging markets. Our alternative data provider uses 3 billion measurements a day to generate a robust statistical regional index of 130 global business centers. Using these measures, we can identify when suddenly the Internet goes down in a region. In case of an outage event happening, policy buyers are automatically reimbursed with a predefined payout.

Riskwolf's uses a cloud-based open-source architecture using streaming technology and microservices. It includes functionality to deliver a lean event-based product innovation, enabling our partners to simulate, test, launch and operate high-frequency event-based insurance products.
